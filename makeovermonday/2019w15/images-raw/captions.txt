30n: Overall fiscal rating is based on five equally-weighted dimensions of solvency: Trust fund, Cash, Long-run, Budget and Service-level. However, a single number cannot convey the volatility in dimension scores and may lead to over-optimistic or over-pessimistic conclusions. For example, Nebraska is ranked 1st, but it has the 37th of 50 worst Budget ranking.
To assess volatility of an overall ranking, I use a mean absolute deviation of five dimensional scores from the overall rating. 
Volatility measure is used to split top 10 ranking states into two groups: Stable fiscal position Volatile fiscal position


30n: Stable fiscal position
30n: Volatile fiscal position

40b: Top 10 States by Overall Rating
30n: T - Trust fund, C - Cash, L - Long-run, B - Budget, S - Service-level

40b: Stability of Fiscal Position


30n: Stable fiscal position

30n: Volatilie fiscal position
