The book "Info We Trust" has six sections. The size of bars below corresponds to a relative importance of words in sections. For example, the word "cathedral" is the most representative word in the "5. INFORMATIONAL" section because it is simultaneously the most frequent word in the section and almost never used in other sections of the book. Words that are frequently used in many sections, like "data" and "color", do not appear as they are universally popular and do not represent any particular section in the book.
Word importance is measured by TF-IDF, which stands for term frequency-inverse document frequency. It is a weight often used in information retrieval and text mining. This weight is a statistical measure used to evaluate how important a word is to a document in a corpus. Here, a document is a section of the book and a corpus is the book "Info We Trust". The importance increases proportionally to the number of times a word appears in the book section but is offset by the frequency of the word in the book.

Words were turned into their dictionary form (lemmatized) prior to analysis. As a result, for example, words "numbers" and "number" are treated as the same word. For more information visit https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemmatisation
